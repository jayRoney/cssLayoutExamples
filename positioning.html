<div class = absoluteParent>
    <div class = "absolute">
        <p>This element behaves like fixed but it's fixed to it's parent, if that makes any sense. It'll continue to
        scroll along the page like any other relative element but it'll be stuck to it's parent, pretty similar to
            how fixed is stuck to the document body.</p>
